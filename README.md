# AI News App

This Streamlit-based app allows you to interact with OpenAI's GPT model for getting summaries of recent AI news. Ask any question about AI, and the model will provide you with a summary based on information from Azure Cognitive Search. The source of data that is used for this app is the following URL: https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/

## Setup

1. **Create Azure AI Search Index**: This can be done very easily using oai.azure.com, where you use the UI to fill an index that supports hybrid search (full-text + vector) for your chosen URL data. It will execute data pre-processing (e.g. chunking) and the vectorization steps with indexation for you.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local environment.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-news-chat.git
    ```

4. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment for the project and activate it in your IDEs terminal (e.g. VSCode).

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
5. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your keys.

    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    SEARCH_KEY=your_azure_search_key
    ```

6. **Azure OpenAI Configuration**: Customize the parameters in the code:

    ```python
    openai.api_base = "your_azure_openai_endpoint"
    deployment_id = "your_deployment_id"
    ```

7. **Azure AI Search Configuration**: Provide your Azure AI Search information:

    ```python
    search_endpoint = "your_search_endpoint"
    search_index_name = "your_search_index_name"
    ```

8. **BYOD (Bring Your Own Data)**: If using your own data, configure the `setup_byod` function by providing your deployment ID. This step allows you to use data sources when sending questions to OpenAI.

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
